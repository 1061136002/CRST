### Introduction
This repository contains the regularized self-training based methods described in the ICCV 2019 paper ["Confidence Regularized Self-training"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09822). Both Class-Balanced Self-Training (CBST) and Confidence Regularized Self-Training (CRST) are implemented. 

### Requirements:
The code is implemented based on [Pytorch 0.4.0](https://pytorch.org/) with CUDA 9.0, OpenCV 3.2.0 and Python 2.7.12. It is tested in Ubuntu 16.04 with a single 12GB NVIDIA TiTan Xp. Maximum GPU usage is about 11GB.

### Setup
We assume you are working in CRST-master folder.

0. Datasets:
- Download [GTA5](https://download.visinf.tu-darmstadt.de/data/from_games/) dataset. Since GTA-5 contains images with different resolutions, we recommend resize all images to 1052x1914. 
- Download [Cityscapes](https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/).
- Put downloaded data in "dataset" folder.
1. Source pretrained models:
- Download [source model](https://www.dropbox.com/s/q6dzd3n0b55jjo7/gta_src.pth?dl=0) trained in GTA5.

### Usage
0. 
- To run the self-training, you need to set the data paths of source data (data-src-dir) and target data (data-tgt-dir) by yourself. Besides that, you can keep other argument setting as default.
Self-training for GTA2Cityscapes:
1. Playing with self-training.
- CBST:
~~~~
sh cbst.sh
~~~~
- CRST-MRKLD:
~~~~
sh mrkld.sh
~~~~
- CRST-LREND:
~~~~
sh lrent.sh
~~~~
2. 
- For CBST, set "--kc-policy cb --kc-value conf".
- We use a small class patch mining strategy to mine the patches including small classes. To turn off small class mining, set "--mine-chance 0.0".
4. Evaluation
- Test in Cityscapes for model compatible with GTA-5 (Initial source trained model as example)
~~~~
sh evaluate.sh
~~~~

5. Train in source domain
- Train in GTA-5
~~~~
sh train.sh
~~~~
- Train in Cityscapes, please check the [original DeepLab-ResNet-Pytorch repository](https://github.com/speedinghzl/Pytorch-Deeplab).

### Note
- This code is based on [DeepLab-ResNet-Pytorch](https://github.com/speedinghzl/Pytorch-Deeplab).
